# BLINKY-NODE
## A terminal interface for using your Blink(1) as a digital office door. 

### Purpose

So, I'm a web developer of a software firm. Only issue is we have an open office floor plan. This means the CTO doesn't have a door to tell everyone that he's busy. Instead he's got this light he puts on his computer that acts like a door.  But I work remote.  So I'm forking his repo and going to set it up so that his status gets broadcast not just through the light but also to a remote server(specifically me)

### Install

```
	yarn
	node .
```

That's it. Enjoy.
